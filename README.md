THEMES
 
Player performance prediction for World Cup matches
Develop a predictive algorithm that forecasts a player's performance accurately in cricket World Cup matches.

Overview
This theme focuses on developing an algorithm to predict the performance of cricket players in World Cup matches. It aims at considering a wide range of factors including historical statistics, recent form, pitch conditions, opposition strength, and even psychological readiness to provide data-driven predictions.

The goal is to enhance the decision-making process for fans and team strategists. The model that you build should be able to predict a player's performance across various formats of the game, such as T20, Test, and One Day matches.

Tech stack
Open to all
Tasks
Create a dynamic and adaptable machine learning model that considers the rapid changes in cricket matches, accounting for variables including, but not limited to, the following:

Changing weather conditions
Form fluctuations
Pitch variations
Ensuring real-time updates and transparency in prediction factors is crucial.

Resources
Cricket statistics databases like ESPN Cricinfo or Cricbuzz
Open-source machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn and TensorFlow
