**2) Cricket for the visually impaired**

**3) Cricket fan travel planning for world cup events**

**4) Cricket language translation**

**5) Open innovation**
#
**D) Theme Selected for implementation under this hackathon:-**  Player performance prediction for World Cup matches

**D1) Overview:-** 

This theme focuses on developing an algorithm to predict the performance of cricket players in World Cup matches. It aims at considering a wide range of factors including historical statistics, recent form, pitch conditions, opposition strength, and even psychological readiness to provide data-driven predictions.

The goal is to enhance the decision-making process for fans and team strategists. The model that you build should be able to predict a player's performance across various formats of the game, such as T20, Test, and One Day matches.

**D2) Tech Stack:-** Open to all

**D3) Tasks:-**

Create a dynamic and adaptable machine learning model that considers the rapid changes in cricket matches, accounting for variables including, but not limited to, the following:

**D3.1)** Changing weather conditions

**D3.2)** Form fluctuations

**D3.3)** Pitch variations

**D3.4)** Ensuring real-time updates and transparency in prediction factors is crucial.

**D4) Resources:-**

**D4.1)** Cricket statistics databases like ESPN Cricinfo or Cricbuzz

**D4.2)** Open-source machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn and TensorFlow

#
**F) About the Dataset:-** A dataset comprising the batting and bowling statistics of the 30 players chosen for the ICC World Cup 2023 from both the Indian and Australian teams has been acquired from the ESPNCrickInfo website. This dataset encompasses the batting and bowling performance metrics for each One Day International (ODI) played by the cricketer throughout their career. Additionally, all the extracted data is as of September 30, 2023.
